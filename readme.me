Post Office Locator Application
Overview

The Post Office Locator Application is a web-based tool that allows users to extract information about the nearest post offices based on their location. The application provides details about the user's IP address, geolocation, and nearby post offices. It includes two main pages: the index page for user interaction and initiation, and the main page displaying detailed information.

    Map Integration: The main page includes a map showcasing the user's current location using Google Maps.

    Post Office Information: The application fetches information about nearby post offices based on the user's postal code and displays it in a user-friendly format.

    Search Functionality: Users can search for specific post offices by name using the search input.
